A simple, flexible, modern HTTP networking framework written in Swift

Based on ideas presented in this [series of blog posts on HTTP](https://davedelong.com/blog/2020/06/27/http-in-swift-part-1/) by [Dave Delong](https://davedelong.com), with my own implementation and modifications. Designed to be extensible and flexible enough to handle communication with most APIs, while being simple enough to easily maintain and modify over time.
